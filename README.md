ajax-web-doc-reader
===================

A simple document reader that asynchronously delivers html files, stored in the directory of the website, to the html/javascript front-end upon request. A php file on the server that the website is hosted on fulfills the javascript GET requests. The Javascript utilizes the built-in javascript XMLHttpRequest object's methods and properties to deliver the data asynchronously to the HTML DOM.
